# Sentiment-analysis

# Good or Bad Classifier with Gemini AI

This is a simple Python project that asks the user to type a sentence and then uses Google Gemini AI to decide if the sentence is “Good” or “Bad.”

✨ How It Works

The program asks the user to type a sentence.

The sentence is sent to Gemini AI with a prompt:
“Classify this sentence as 'good' or 'bad'.”

Gemini returns an answer (Good or Bad).

The program prints Gemini’s response.


💡 Example
Type a sentence: I love my freind
Gemini says: Good
